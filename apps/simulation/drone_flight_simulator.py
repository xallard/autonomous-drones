# drone_flight_simulator.py
# Script for simulating drone flight in various conditions using Gazebo in Autonomous-Drones

# For the Autonomous-Drones project, let's create a fictitious Python script that focuses on using Gazebo, a popular robot simulation software, for simulating drone flight in various conditions. This script, potentially named drone_flight_simulator.py, will be dedicated to setting up and running drone flight simulations, which are crucial for testing and validating autonomous flight algorithms. This file would fit well in a simulation-specific module within the project.

# In this script:

# A DroneFlightSimulator class is created to handle spawning and deleting drone models in the Gazebo simulator.
# The script uses ROS (Robot Operating System) services to interact with Gazebo for spawning and deleting models.
# The spawn_drone method spawns a drone at a given position in the simulation environment.
# The delete_drone method removes the drone from the simulation.
# This setup assumes the existence of a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file that describes the drone model.
# This script, as part of the simulation module in the Autonomous-Drones project, would be essential for testing and validating the behavior of autonomous drones in controlled, simulated environments before actual deployment.
